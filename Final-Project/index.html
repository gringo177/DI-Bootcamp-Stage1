<h2><a id="top">Story of Israel and Golda Meir</a></h2>
  <h1>Early life</h1>

  <p>Golda Mabovitch was born to a Jewish family in downtown Kyiv, Russian Empire (present-day Ukraine) on May 3, 1898, to Blume Neiditch (died 1951) and Moshe Mabovitch (died 1944), a carpenter. Meir wrote in her autobiography that her earliest memories were of her father boarding up the front door in response to rumours of an imminent pogrom. She had two sisters, Sheyna (born 1889) and Tzipke (born 1902), as well as five other siblings who died in childhood.</p>

  <p>Meir's father, Moshe, left the country to find work in New York City in 1903. In his absence, the rest of the family moved to Pinsk (present-day Belarus) to join her mother's family. In 1905, Moshe moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in search of higher-paying work, and found employment in the workshops of the local railroad yard. The following year, he had saved up enough money to bring his family to the United States. Golda along with her mother and sisters landed in Quebec and traveled to Milwaukee by train</p>

  <h2>Return to Milwaukee, Zionist activism, and teaching</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>In 1914, after disagreements with her sister, Golda left North High School, moved out of her sister's home, and found work.</li>
    <li>After reconciling with her parents, she returned to Milwaukee and resumed studies at North Division High, graduating in 1915.</li>
    <li>While there, she became an active member of Young Poale Zion, which later became Habonim, the Labor Zionist youth movement.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Immigration to Mandatory Palestine</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>In 1921, after the conclusion of the war, the couple moved to Palestine, then part of the British Mandate, along with Meir's sister Sheyna, Sheyna's daughter, and Meir's childhood friend Regina.</li>
    <li>They sailed on the SS Pocahontas, from New York to Naples, then from there to Tel Aviv by train. Meir's parents subsequently moved to Palestine in 1926.</li>
    <li>They were eventually accepted into kibbutz Merhavia in the Jezreel Valley after an initial rejected application. Her duties included picking almonds, planting trees, working in the chicken coops, and running the kitchen.</li>
    <li>Process all the ingredients into a paste.</li>
  </ol>

 <p>Recognizing her leadership abilities, the kibbutz chose her as its representative to the Histadrut, the General Federation of Labour.

In 1924, the couple left the kibbutz and lived briefly in Tel Aviv before settling in Jerusalem. There, they had two children: a son Menachem in 1924, and a daughter Sarah in 1926. Meir returned to Merhavia for a brief period in 1925.</p>

  <h1>Early political career</h1>
  <p>In  <strong>1928, Meir was elected secretary</strong>of Moetzet HaPoalot Working Women's Council. <em>She</em> spent two years <strong><em>in the United States</em> as an emissary for the organization</strong> and to get expert medical treatment for her daughter's kidney illness.<strong>In 1934, when Meir returned</strong>from the United States, <em>she joined the Executive Committee </em> of the Histadrut and moved up the ranks <em>to become the head of its Political Department. </em></p>

  <p>
    This appointment was important training for her future role in Israeli leadership.</i> In July 1938, Meir was the Jewish observer from Palestine at the Ã‰vian Conference, called by President Franklin D. Roosevelt of the United States to discuss the question of Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi persecution.

          <p>Following the Yom Kippur War, Meir's government was plagued by infighting and questions over Israel's lack of preparation for the war. The Agranat Commission appointed to investigate the war cleared Meir of "direct responsibility". It said about her actions on Yom Kippur morning:

She decided wisely, with common sense and speedily, in favour of the full mobilization of the reserves, as recommended by the chief-of-staff, despite weighty political considerations, thereby performing a most important service for the defence of the state.</p>
